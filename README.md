# Cryptocurrencies
* I created an analysis of the Cryptocurrency market by utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning.
* I cleaned and preprocessed the data utilizing pandas and the StandardScaler Library in order to perfom Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm
* Using the PCA algorithm, I reduced the dimensions to 3 principal components
* I created an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for k (number of clusters for the data),  then ran the K-means algorithm to predict the clusters for data
* Lastly, I used hvplot to create a 3D scatter plot to visualize the results
